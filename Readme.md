# FFfD: Form Filler for Devs
### A highly useful extension that fills up any form with random values. It can be used extensively for development and testing.

This tool is a boon for developers and testers. Developers can use it to fill up any form while development, be it a basic login form or a complicated form with 100s of fields, this add on can complete that task for you in a flash.
While testing, filling up a full form every time is very annoying for testers to touch different edge cases. The upcoming versions of this add on will also support dynamic (not random) values fill up support.
